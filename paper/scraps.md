pi: E\rightarrow K
tau: K \rightarrow E

for foundation:
\tau: K (type) \rightarow E(type)

fibration (generalization) of fiber bundles which is generalizatuion of trivial bundle -> E = F \times K , trivial is map from E to F, 

trivial bundle - globally defined map from E to F, 

category theory: product: thing + arrows away from it, sum: thing + arrows go in 

tau: K \rightarrow F (function), (is key value construction)


Hom(K,F) \rightarrow f Hom(K, F') -> structure preserving operation , push forward

meters for type F, inchs for type F', f is meters to inches, you keep the K

K'\rightarrow g K \rightarrow \tau F
g*\tau = \tau \circ g: K' \rightarrow F

Hom(K, F) \rightarrow g* Hom(K prime, F): K'= U \subset K, example g is restriction

if we have F w/ scale and translations or rotations or other allowed F, talking about how they act on functions, how that transforms, map it to visualizations, 
morphisms need to be preserved through to visualizations

one object category is a monoid

equivariance is that a monoid is preserved /all the diagrams would commute 

catagory w/ data bundles 

wrong: E->E'

special class of decators that only modify ootput or input
    - pair(g,f) are restricted decorators on bundles
    - takes functions to functions and sections to sections

nu is a postcompose bundle map (don't touch K)
    - post compose is a covariant
    - operation on outputs
xi is a precompose bundle map
    - operation on args

category theory is basically "equivariant by definition"


some transformations will just push forwards (scale, color, etc)

ex: change hatch density -> Q is not equivariant on bundle level at like change hatch density cause no map on the bundle - Hatch density is a parameter of rho

for some variables, Q is like nu and can demand equivariance, but not when we need to change the rho - then we push the equivariance down to the rho

can be made equivariant on ImQ if property of Q holds

double check def of full subcategory
- full subcategory of data bundles
  - consists of continous maps/continous transformations of keys, fiberwise maps
  - nu knows how to take fibers to fibers: F to P, postcomposes, can do chained nu
  - precomposing w/ nu if it's still over K


whichever categories that you're allowing, maps include continous maps on subspaces, any map from bundle to bundles , restricts to structure preserving maps on the bundle, once define the fiber then other category is determined, those are not allowed, this subcategory is defined, input type is objects, output type is objects, what are these objects? 
functor maps objects in one category to objects in other category, objects may not be sets, elements of these objects are sections

A(\Gamma(K,E)) = \Gamma(S,H)
C \rightarrow A D

{* \in c}}\rightarrow h K, h*E = F, \tau*K = tau(k)  \in F)k

diagram where S->K, which gives what rho corresponds to tau (with point inclusions)

b/c you can map points, you can map sections to S
allowed:K and subset K

category of subsets w. inclusions. etc..

continuity is cause continuous maps
