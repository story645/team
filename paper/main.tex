\section{Data And Visualizations}
\label{sec:atct}
\note{why why why?}
We use concepts from algberaic topolology and category theory to formally express the structure visualization components are expected to preserve.  Fiber bundles and sheaves, which come from algebraic topolology, provide a uniform generalizable way to describe data and visualizations. Category theory is a method to describe how objects are specified, constrained, and composed \cite{wielsManagementEvolvingSpecifications1998}\; therefore in this work we propose categorical constructions of visualization components as specifications for implementable components.

\subsection{Fiber Bundles}
\label{sec:atct:fiber-bundles}
Fiber bundles, are a "unified, dimension-independent framework", as described by Butler\cite{butlerVectorBundleClassesForm1992,butlerVisualizationModelBased1989}, that allow us to seperatly describe the topological properties and fields of a data source and also the mapping between topolology and data values. A fiber bundle $(\dtotalc, \dbasec, \pi, \dfiberc)$ is a structure with topological spaces $\dtotalc, \dfiberc, \dbasec$ and continuous surjective map $\pi: \dtotalc \rightarrow \dbasec$\cite{FiberBundle2020}. 

\begin{equation}[h]
  \label{eq:atct:fb:intro}
  \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&, row sep=huge]
   \dfiberc
    \arrow[r, hook, color=total] \& 
    \dtotalc
    \arrow[d, "\pi"',color=total] \\
     \& 
  \dbasec
     \arrow[u, "\dsectionc"', bend right, pos=.5, color=section]
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation} 

The \textcolor{base}{base space} is a topological space \dbasec\ with points $\dbasepointc \in \dbasec$ and topology $\mathcal{T}_{\dbasec}$; $\mathcal{T}_k$ is a set of opensets $ \dbasepointc \in \opensetc \subseteqq \dbasec$ \cite{munkresElementsAlgebraicTopology1984} that cover the base space \dbasec.  The \textcolor{fiber}{fiber space} is a topological space \dfiberc\ that is the preimage of the projection function $\pi$ at a point in the base space $\dfiber_{\dbasepointc} = \pi^{-1}(\dbasepointc)$ and fibers of a bundle are isomorphic $\dfiberc \simeq \dfiberc_{\dbasepointc}\;\forall \dbasepointc \in \dbase$. The \textcolor{section}{sections} of a bundle $\dsection$ are maps from the base space to points in the bundles over that base space and $\textcolor{set}{\Gamma}$ denotes the set of all sections in a bundle over an openset. 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:fb:sections}
  \cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} \coloneqq \big\{\dsectionc: \opensetc\rightarrow \dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc} \; \bigm{\vert} \pi(\dsectionc(\dbasepointc)) = \dbasepointc\;for\, all\; \dbasepointc \in \opensetc \big\} 
\end{equation}
 
A fiber bundle is locally trivial, which means that for every point \dbasepointc\ there exists an open neighborhood $\dbasepointc \in \opensetc \subseteq \dbasec$ such that there is a homeomorphism $\pi^{-1}(\opensetc)\xrightarrow{\equivc} \opensetc \times \dfiberc$. A bundle may be globally trivial, meaning that $\dtotalc = \dbasec \times \dfiberc$, and generally can be thought of as a twisted product of total and base spaces \cite{munkresElementsAlgebraicTopology1984}. 


Fiber bundles can be used to model data for visualization, as proposed by Butler\cite{butlerVectorBundleClassesForm1992, butlerVisualizationModelBased1989}. We describe the topological properties of the data \cite{wilkinsonGrammarGraphics2005} as the base space \dbasec. The topological properties, as described by Wilkenson, are how the data is organized - for example \dbase\ could be discrete points, a line, a 2D surface, a 3D volume, or a graph. The names and data types of the data fields can be expressed as the fiber space \dfiberc, as described by Spivak \cite{spivakDatabasesAreCategories2010,spivakSIMPLICIALDATABASES}. 

Fiber bundles can be used to model data for visualization, as proposed by Butler\cite{butlerVectorBundleClassesForm1992, butlerVisualizationModelBased1989}.  Even though fibers on non-trivial spaces, such as vector fields, are different, we simplify and represent all fibers with the same schema because fibers are isomorphic.

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \label{fig:atct:fb}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{fb_tau.png}
  \caption{change to concrete example}
\end{figure} 

As illustrated in \autoref{fig:atct:fb}, \note{figure out what the actual data example should be}


We also use fiber bundles to represent the output of a visualization algorithm, which we term the graphic but generalizes to output on any display space, such as a screen or 3D print. 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:fb:graphic}
  \gfiberc \hookrightarrow \gtotalc \xrightarrow{\pi} \gbasec
\end{equation}
The base space \gbasec\ is a parameterization of the display area, for example the inked bounding box in cairo \cite{CairographicsOrg}. The fiber space \gfiberc\ is an abstraction of the renderer fields, for example $\{x,\,y,\,r,\,g,\,b,\,a\}$. The sections of the graphic 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:fb_graphic_section}
  \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} \coloneqq \big\{\gsectionc: \opensetgc\rightarrow \gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc} \; \bigm{\vert} \pi(\gsectionc(\gbasepointc)) = \gbasepointc\;for\, all\; \gbasepointc \in \opensetgc \big\}
\end{equation}
are functions that generate different graphics, for example markers for a scatter plot, bars for a bar chart, cells of a heatmap, or pixels of an image.


\begin{figure}[h!]
  \label{fig:atct:fb:graphic}
  \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{fb_rho.png}
  \caption{}
\end{figure}
In \autoref{fig:atct:fb:graphic}, the section function $\gsection$ encodes the drawing of the \note{pin down what's beeing drawn}.   
The renderer subsamples the position fibers  \textit{x} and \textit{y} of the graphic fiber space \gfiber. The preimage of the section at these coordinates returns a set of coordinates ${\gsection^{-1}_{x,y}} = \{\gbasepoint | \gsection(\gbasepoint)\restriction_{x,y} = \(x,y\)\}$ at the points $\gbasepoint \in \gbase$ in the graphic base topological space. The section is then evaluated at these points $\gsection\restriction_{\gsection^{-1}_{x,y}}$ to return a set of points in the fiber. Each point has an RGB tuple and these tuples are integrated to return the color of the pixel at that $(x,y)$ point. 

\subsection{Input and Output Types}
\label{sec:atct:io}
As described in \autoref{sec:atct:fiber-bundles}, we model data as a map from base space to fiber space.To encapsulate the structure carried in these maps, and provide a way to define these maps in reusable and composable manner, we define categories of base and fiber spaces. 

\begin{definition}
  \label{sec:atct:io:base}
  The base space category $\mathcal{\opensetc}$ has open set objects $\opensetc$ and inclusion morphisms $\iota: \opensetc_1 \rightarrow \opensetc_2$ such that $\opensetc_1 \subseteq \opensetc_2$. 
\end{definition}

By definition, each object in a category has an identity morphism and morphisms are associative and commutative \cite{barrCategoryTheoryComputing}. 

\begin{definition}
  \label{def:atct:io:fiber}
  The fiber category $\mathcal{\dfiberc}$ is a monoidal category, meaning the category has a single object $\dfiberc$ of an arbitrary type. The morphisms on the fiber object are $\dfunctc \in Hom(\dfiberc, \dfiberc)$. 
\end{definition}

The fiber category is equipped with a bifunctor $\otimes: \mathcal{\dfiber} \times {\dfiber}$. The bifunctor provides a method for combining fibers, thereby allowing for fields that contain multityped values. For example, RGB color can either be represented as three fiber fields $\dfiber_{red}, \dfiber_{green}, \dfiber_{blue}$ or a composite fiber field $\dfiber_{red} \otimes \dfiber_{green} \otimes \dfiber_{blue} = \dfiber_{RGB}$.

\subsection{Sheaves}
\label{sec:atct:sheaves}
Sheaves on bundles are an "algebraic data structure", as described by Ghrist \cite{ghristElementaryAppliedTopology2014}, for expressing the bookkeeping involved in keeping track of sections of data over opensets. Sheaves are a way of expressing that subsets, distributed data, and streaming data are local sections that can be glued together. Formally, pre-sheaves are functors, meaning they are functions from objects of one category to objects of another category \cite{WhatFunctorDefinitions}. Here the sheaf 
\begin{equation}
  \sheafc_{\dbasec, \dtotalc}: \opensetc \rightarrow \cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}}
\end{equation}
denotes a sheaf from opensets on the base space $\dbase$ to sets of sections on the bundle $\dtotal$. As a contravariant functor it preserves morphism s

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:presheaf}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \cgamma{\opensetc_1}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc_1}}  &  & \cgamma{\opensetc_2}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc_2}} 
    \arrow[ll, "\iota^*"', maps to, color=set] \\
    & & \\
    \opensetc_1 
    \arrow[rr, "\iota", maps to, color=base] 
    \arrow[uu, "{\sheafc_{\dbasec, \dtotalc}}", maps to, color=sheaf] &  & \opensetc_2 
    \arrow[uu, "{\sheafc_{\dbasec, \dtotalc}}"', maps to, color=sheaf]              
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}

which associates a set of sections $\cgamma{\openset}{\dtotal\restriction_{\openset}}$ with an openset \openset. The sets of sections are objects of the category \setc\ and the morphisms of the category are restrictions\footnote{restriction functions } $\iota^*$. The sheaf over a an open set $\openset$ surrounding a point $\dbasepoint$ is called a stalk\cite{StalkSheaf2019}
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:sheaf:stalk}
    \sheaf_{\dbase, \dtotalc}\restriction_{\dbasepoint}\coloneqq \lim\limits_{\openset\ni \dbasepoint} \Gamma(\openset, \dtotal\restriction_{\openset}) 
\end{equation}
where the fiber is contained inside the stalk  $\dfiber_{\dbasepoint} \subset  \sheaf_{\dbase, \dtotal}\restriction_{\dbasepoint}$. The germ is the section evaluated at a point in the stalk  $\dsection(\dbasepoint) \in \sheaf_{\dbase, \dtotal}\restriction_{\dbasepoint}$ and is the data. \note{I never use stalk and germ terminology at any point in this paper}
 
A sheaf is a presheaf that satisfies the locality and gluing axioms \cite{bakerMathsSheaf}. 
\begin{definition}
\label{def:atct:sheaf:locality}
The locality axiom is that given a union of opensets $\mathscr{\opensetc} = \bigcup\limits_{i\in I} \opensetc_i$ and $\dsectionc^{a}, \dsectionc^{b} \in \sheafc(\mathscr{\opensetc})$,  if $\dsectionc^{a}\restriction_{\opensetc_i} = \dsectionc^{b}\restriction_{\opensetc_i}$ for each $\opensetc_i \in \opensetc$ then $\dsectionc^{a} = \dsectionc^{b}$
\end{definition}
This means that two sections in a sheaf are equal when they evaluate to the same values over all open sets in a collection. 
\begin{definition}
\label{def:atct:sheaf:gluing}
The gluing axiom is that given $\dsectionc^{i} \in \sheafc(\opensetc_i)$ such that ${\dsectionc^{i}}\restriction_{\opensetc_i\cap \opensetc_j} = {\dsectionc^{j}}\restriction_{\opensetc_i \cap \opensetc_j}$ for $\opensetc_i, \opensetc_j \in \mathscr{\opensetc}$, there exists $\dsectionc \in \sheafc(\mathscr{\opensetc})$ such that $\dsectionc\restriction_{\opensetc_i} = {\dsectionc^{i}}$. 
\end{definition}
This means we can construct a section $\dsection$ on the collection of open sets that is the union of sections defined on specific open sets. This expresses an equivalency between a concatenated represetation of data and the distributed representation of the same data. 

In this model, we represent data and graphics as a sheaf; doing so allows us to express that data sources are expected to have the bookkeeping that a sheaf requires, meaning inclusions, restrictions, locality, and gluing must be preserved. 

\subsubsection{Structure on Data}
\label{sec:atct:sheaves:measurments}
We define structure on data as the allowable \textcolor{action}{transformations on the bundle}, which we formalize as actions $\dfuncc$ on sections of that sheaf. Our construction of $\dfunc$ is a generalization of the classification of measurement scales by their mathematical structure \cite{stevensTheoryScalesMeasurement1946,leaFormalizationMeasurementScale, thomasMathematizationNotMeasurement2014}, which often serves as the basis of the equivariance described in \autoref{sec:related-work:equivariance}.

We separate data transformations into two types, transformations on the base space $(\dfunchc, \dfuncpullc)$ and transformations on the fiber space $\dfunctc$. 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:sheaves:monoid_morphism}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} 
    \arrow[rr, "\dfuncpullc", color=action, maps to] &  & 
    \cgamma{\opensetc^{\prime}}{\dfuncpullc\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc^{\prime}}} & 
    \cgamma{\opensetc^{\prime}}{\dfuncpullc\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc^{\prime}}} 
    \arrow[dd, "\dfunctc", color=action] \\
     &  & &       \\
    \opensetc 
    \arrow[uu, maps to,color=sheaf]  &  & \opensetc^{\prime} 
    \arrow[ll, "\dfunchc"', color=action, maps to] 
    \arrow[uu, maps to, color=sheaf] & \cgamma{\opensetc^{\prime}}{\dfuncpullc\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc^{\prime}}}                       
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
As shown in \autoref{eq:atct:sheaves:monoid_morphism}, the base space transform 
\begin{equation}
 \label{eq:atct:morphism:base}
\dfunch: \openset^{\prime}\rightarrow \openset
\end{equation}
is from one open set to another open set in the same base space $\openset, \openset^{\prime} \subseteq \dbase$. For example a remapping of an underlying indexing, such as a sorting of primary keys for a database of discrete values. This base space transformation induces a pullback section 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:morphism:basepull}
  \dfuncpull \dsection \restriction_{\openset^{\prime}}: \dsection\restriction_{\openset^{\prime}} \mapsto \dsection \restriction_{\openset^{\prime} \circ \dfunch} 
\end{equation}
such that $\dsection|_{\openset} = \dfuncpull\dsection|_{\opensetc^{\prime}}$ because $\dsection|_{\openset} = \dsection|_{\dfunch(\opensetc^{\prime})}$. This means that the base space transformation \dfunch\ does not change the data values at a given point
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:morphism:verify_base}
  \dsection(\dbase) = \dfuncpull\dsectionc(\dbasepoint^{\prime}) = \dsection(\dfunch(\dbase^{prime}))
\end{equation} 
where $\dfunch(\dbasepoint^{\prime}) = \dfunch(\dbasepoint)$. As introduced in \autoref{def:atct:io:fiber}, the fiber transformation $\dfunct: \dfuncpull \dtotal_{\dbasepoint^{\prime}} \rightarrow \dfuncpull \dtotal_{\dbasepoint^{\prime}}$ is a morphism on the fiber $\dfunct \in Hom(\dfuncpull\dfiber\restriction_{\dbasepoint^{\prime}},\dfuncpull\dfiber\restriction_{\dbasepoint^{\prime}})$ restricted to a point $\dbasepoint^{\prime} \in \openset^{\prime}$. The fiber transformation is a change in section 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:morphism:fiber}
  \dfunct: \dfuncpull \dsection \restriction_{\openset^{\prime}} \mapsto \dfuncpull \dsection^{\prime} \restriction_{\openset}
\end{equation}
where $\dsection, \dsection^{\prime} \in \Gamma(\openset^{\prime}, \dfuncpull\dtotal\restriction_{\openset^{\prime}})$. Examples of a fiber transformation are actions such as partial ordering for ranking purpose \cite{bruggemannRankingPrioritizationMultiindicator2011} and the permutation, ordering, translation, and scaling codified as Steven's measurement scales \cite{stevensTheoryScalesMeasurement1946}. 

We define a full data transformation as one that induces both a remapping of the index space and a change in the data values
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:morphism:all}
  \dfuncc: \dsectionc\restriction_{\opensetc} \mapsto \dsectionc^{\prime}\restriction_{\opensetc} \circ \dfunchc
\end{equation}
which gives us an equation that can express complex transformations. For example, wind vectors on a sphere are a non-trivial bundle, meaning their fibers aren't identical at every point in the base space; therefore a rotation (change of base space) of the sphere must include an adjustment to the values that have moved closer to the pole (a change in fiber).  
The data transform \dfunc\ is composable 
\begin{equation}
  \dfuncc = (\dfunchc, \prod\limits_{i=0}^{n}\dfunctc_i)
\end{equation}
if each (identical) component base space is transformed in the same way $\dfunch$ and there exists functions $\dfunc_{a,b}: \dtotal_a \times \dtotal_b \rightarrow \dtotal_a \times \dtotal_b$, $\dfunc_{a}: \dtotal_a \rightarrow \dtotal_a$ and $\dfunc_{b}: \dtotal_b \rightarrow \dtotal_b$ such that $\pi_a \circ \dfunc_a = \dfunc_{a,b} \circ \pi_a$ and $\pi_b \circ \dfunc_b = \dfunc_{a,b} \circ \pi_b$ then $\dfunc_{a,b} = (\dfunc_a, \dfunc_b)$. This allows us to define a data transform where each fiber transform $\dfunct_{i}$ can be applied to a different fiber field $\dfiber_i$. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \label{fig:atct:phi}
  \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{phi.png}
\end{figure}
\autoref{fig:atct:phi} provides an example of a base space change \dfunch, a fiber space change \dfunct, and a composition of the two \dfunc\ applied to each data point $x_{\dbasepoint} \in \texttt{data}$. As defined in \autoref{eq:atct:morphism:verify_base}, 
since transposition is a $(\dfunch, \dfuncpull)$, every data value $x_{\dbasepoint}$ must be equal to the value at the corresponding location in the transposed matrix $x_{\dbasepoint} = x_{\dbasepoint^{\prime}}, \dfunch(\dbasepoint^{\prime}) = \dbasepoint$ for all $x_{\dbasepoint^{\prime}} \in texttt{data.T}$ . In \autoref{fig:atct:phi}, this is demonstrated in the columns becoming rows such that there are no new values and each value retains the same neighboring values. As defined in \autoref{eq:atct:morphism:fiber} scaling is a transform $\dfunct$ that changes the value of each point but not its location. In \autoref{fig:atct:phi}, this means that $x_{\dbasepoint^{\prime}}= 2*x_{\dbasepoint}, \dbasepoint = \dbasepoint_{\prime}$ for all indices in \textt{data}, \textt{data.T}. As defined in \autoref{eq:atct:morphism:all} and illustrated in \autoref{fig:atct:phi}, these transformations can combine to yield a matrix that is both transposed and scaled such that $x_{\dbasepoint^{\prime}} = 2*x_{\dbasepoint}$ for all  
$\dfunch(\dbasepoint^{\prime}) = \dbasepoint$

\subsection{Maps Between Spaces}
The data sections defined in \autoref{eq:atct:fb} are sections of sheaves, introduced in \autoref{sec:atct:sheaves}, over open sets $\openset \subseteq \dbase$ in a base space \dbase\ that encodes the topology of the data topology. The graphic sections, defined in \autoref{eq:atct:fb_graphic_section}, are sections of sheaves over open sets $\opensetg \subseteq \gbase$ in a base space \gbase\ that encodes the topology of the graphic. We propose that there exists a continuous \textcolor{functor}{map between topological spaces} \vindexc 
\begin{equation}
  \vindexc: \opensetgc \rightarrow \opensetc 
\end{equation}
such that every $\opensetg \subseteq \gbase$ must map to a corresponding set $\openset \subset \dbase$. 

Given the map between spaces \vindex\, a property of sheaves is that there exist image functors\cite{ImageFunctorsSheaves2021} functors \vindexpull\ and \vindexpush. The \textcolor{functor}{pullback functor} $\vindexpullc$ sends sheaves over $\dbase$ to $\gbase$ and the \textcolor{functor}{pushforward functor} $\vindexpushc$  sends sheaves over $\gbase$ to $\dbase$
\begin{equation}

  \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} 
  \arrow[ll, "\vindexpushc"', maps to, color=functor]                                                         
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
such that there is an association between graphic sections \gsection\ that take as input \gbasepoint\ and data sections that take input \dbasepointc\ when $\vindex(\gbasepoint) = \dbasepoint$. 

The pull back $\vindexpullc$ transports sheaves of sections on $\openset \subseteq \dbase$ over $\opensetg \subseteq \gbase$
\begin{equation}
  \vindexpullc\dsectionc: \opensetgc \rightarrow \vindexpullc \dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc} \in \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\vindexpullc\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} 
\end{equation}
such that there is a way to then look up what data values correspond with a graphic index
\begin{equation}
  \vindexpullc\dsectionc(\gbasepointc) = \dsectionc(\vindex(\gbasepointc)) = \dsectionc(\dbasepointc)
\end{equation}

 The pushforward $\vindexpushc$ transports sheaves of sections on $\opensetgc$ over $\openset$
 \begin{equation}  
  \vindexpushc\gsectionc: \opensetc \rightarrow \vindexpushc \gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc} \in \cgamma{\opensetc}{\vindexpushc\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} 
\end{equation}
such that it provides a way to look up which graphic  corresponds with a data index
\begin{equation}
  \vindexpushc\gsectionc(\dbasepointc) = \gsectionc\restriction_{\vindexprec(\dbasepointc)} = \gsectionc(\gbasepointc)\;\forall \gbasepointc\in \vindexprec(\dbasepointc)
\end{equation}

Therefore, the continuous map $\vindex$ and transport functors $\vindexpull, \vindexpush$ allow us to express the correspondence between graphic section and data section.

Functors between sheaves are a way of expressing the bookkeeping involved in keeping track of which graphic section corresponds to which data section. This allows us to construct graphic specifications for each data index $\vindexpush\gsection$ and retrieve the data $\vindexpull\dsection$ for any graphic section generating any piece of a graphic. As illustrated in \autoref{fig:atct:morphisms:sheaf}, the \note{image functors?}

We propose that visualization libraries implement morphisms from a data sheaf $\sheafc_{\dtotal, \dbase}$ to a graphic sheaf $\sheafc_{\gtotal, \gbase}$ 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:sheaves:homset}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} 
    \arrow[dd, "\textcolor{set}{Hom}_{\sheafc_{\dbasec}}"', color=homset] 
    \arrow[rrdd, "\textcolor{set}{Hom}_{\sheafc_{\dbasec},\sheafc_{\gbasec}}", color=homset] 
    \arrow[rr, "\vindexpullc", color=functor] &  &
    \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\vindexpullc\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} 
    \arrow[dd, "\textcolor{set}{Hom}_{\sheafc_{\gbasec}}", color=homset] \\
     & & \\
    \cgamma{\opensetc}{\vindexpushc\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} &  & 
    \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} 
    \arrow[ll, "\vindexpushc"', color=functor]                  
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
and the hom set is the set of all morphisms from one sheaf to the other. The functors $\vindexpullc, \vindexpushc$ are adjoint, meaning that there is a functorial isomorphism \cite{harder2008lectures} such that 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:sheaves:homset:functors}
\begin{split}
  & \textcolor{set}{Hom}_{\sheafc_{\gbasec}}(\vindexpullc\sheafc_{\dtotalc, \dbasec},\sheafc_{\gtotalc,\gbasec})\\
  \simeq & \textcolor{set}{Hom}_{\sheafc_{\dbasec}}(\sheafc_{\dtotalc, \dbasec},\vindexpushc\sheafc_{\gtotalc,\gbasec}) \\
  \simeq & \textcolor{set}{Hom}_{\sheafc_{\dbasec},\sheafc_{\gbasec}}(\sheafc_{\dtotalc, \dbasec},\sheafc_{\gtotalc,\gbasec}) \\
\end{split} 
\end{equation}
which means that the diagram of sheaf morphisms \autoref{eq:atct:sheaves:homset} is commutative; therefore the functors $\vindexpullc$ and $\vindexpushc$ can be used to adapt morphisms written over one space to another space. 
This provides us flexibility over which space to construct data to graphic transforms. For example, specifications such as svg\cite{quintScalable2003} and Vega\cite{satyanarayanDeclarativeInteractionDesign2014}, typically define their transformations in data space and return specifications for the render to evaluate. An artist may also want to specify the transformations in a proxy of graphic space, for example for operations like dynamic resampling \note{citation:root maybe}. 


\section{Artist: Data to Graphic}
\label{sec:artist}
In this work we propose that visualization libraries are implementing a subset of the functions in the hom sets in \autoref{eq:atct:sheaves:homset} and we call these subset of functions the artist:
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:artist:hom_transport}
  \vartistc:& \cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}}\textcolor{artist}{\rightarrow} \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} \in \textcolor{set}{Hom}_{\sheafc_{\dbase}, \sheafc_{\gbase}}\\
  \vartistc^{\dbasec}:&\cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}}  \textcolor{artist}{\rightarrow} \cgamma{\opensetc}{\vindexpushc\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} \in \textcolor{set}{Hom}{\sheafc_{\dbase}}\\
  \vartistc^{\gbasec}:& \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\vindexpullc\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} \textcolor{artist}{\rightarrow} \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} \in \textcolor{set}{Hom}_{\sheafc_{\gbase}}
\end{align}
 Because the artists can be constructed as morphisms of sheave over the same base spaces, as listed in \autoref{eq:atct:sheaves:homset:functors}, they are natural transformations
\begin{align}
  \label{eq:artist:natural_transform}
  \vartistc^{\dbasec}:& \sheafc_{\dbasec, \dtotalc} \textcolor{artist}{\Rightarrow} \vindexpushc \sheafc_{\gbasec, \gtotalc}\\
  \vartistc^{\gbasec}:&\vindexpullc\sheafc_{\dbasec, \dtotalc} \textcolor{artist}{\Rightarrow}\sheafc_{\gbasec, \gtotalc}
\end{align}
which means that they are maps of functors that take the same input object and return objects in the same category\cite{milewskiCategoryTheoryProgrammers}. As illustrated in \autoref{eq:atct:sheaves:homset}, the sheaf functors
\begin{equation}
    \begin{tikzcd}
      \cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} &  & \opensetc \arrow[ll, "{\sheafc_{\dbasec, \dtotalc}}"', maps to, color=sheaf] \arrow[rr, "{\vindexpushc\sheafc_{\gbasec, \gtotalc}}", maps to, color=sheaf] &  & \cgamma{\opensetc}{\vindexpushc\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} 
      \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
take as input the same object \opensetc\ and return sets of data and graphic sections that are objects in \setb. As a map between these sheaf functors, the artist has to preserve the $\iota, \iota^*$ morphisms of the presheaf functor, described in \autoref{eq:atct:presheaf}, such that the following diagram commutes

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:artist:natural_transform:inclusions}
  \begin{tikzcd}
    \opensetc_1 & \cgamma{\opensetc_{1}}{\dtotalc\restruction_{\opensetc_1}} \arrow[dd, "\iota^*"', color=set] \arrow[rr, "\vartistc_{\opensetc_1}", color=artist] &  & \cgamma{\opensetc_{1}}{\vindexpushc\gtotalc\restruction_{\opensetc_1}} \arrow[dd, "\iota^*", color=set] \\
      &  &  &  \\
    \opensetc_{2} \arrow[uu, "\iota", hook, color=base] & \cgamma{\opensetc_{2}}{\dtotalc\restruction_{\opensetc_2}} \arrow[rr, "\vartistc_{\opensetc_2}", color=artist]                        &  & \cgamma{\opensetc_{2}}{\vindexpushc\gtotalc\restruction_{\opensetc_2}}                      
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
 The diagram in \autoref{eq:artist:natural_transform} shows that restricting a set of outputs of an artist to a set of graphic sections over a subspace is equivalent to restricting the inputs to data sections over the same subspace. Since the input and output of the artist is always sections over the same subspace, this is why the by construction the artist preserves the bookkeeping provided through the use of sheaves. 

The output of an artist \vartist\ is a restricted subset of graphic sections
\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
  \imartist{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} &\coloneqq\\ 
  &\{\gsectionc\vert\;\exists\;\dsectionc \in \cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}}\;s.t.\; 
  \vartistc(\dsectionc) = \gsectionc,\; \vindexc(\opensetgc) = \opensetc \} 
  \end{split}
\end{equation} 
that are, by definition, only reachable through a structure preserving artist, which we describe in \autoref{sec:artist:equivariance}. We define this subset because the space of all sections $\cgamma{\opensetg}{\gtotal\restriction_{\openset}}$ includes sections that may not be structure preserving. For example, a section may go from every point in the graphic space to the same single point in the graphic fiber $\gsection(\gbasepoint_i) = d\; \forall \gbasepoint \in \gbase$ such that the visual output is a single inked pixel on a screen. 

\subsection{Equivariance}
The notion of structure preservation discussed in \autoref{sec:related-work:continuity} is that data and components of the graphic vary in equivalent ways. We describe the changes on the graphic side as changes in measurments \measure\, which are scaler or vector components of the rendered graphic that can be quantified, such as the color, position, shape, texture, or rotation angle of the graphic. The visual variables \cite{bertinIIPropertiesGraphic2011} are a subset of measurable components. For example, a measurement of a scatter marker could be its color (e.g. red) or its x position (e.g. 5). 

We formalize this structure preservation as equivariance, which is that for every morphism on the data $(\dfunch_{\dtotal}, \dfunct_{\dtotal})$ there is an equivalent morphism on the graphic  $(\dfunch_{\gtotal}, \dfunct_{\gtotal})$ The artist is an equivariant map if the diagram commutes for all points $\gbasepointc^{\prime}\in \gbasec^{\prime}$
\label{sec:artist:equivariance}
\begin{equation}
  \autoref{eq:artist:equivariance}
  \begin{tikzcd}[ampersand replacement=\&, column sep=small]
  \cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} 
  \arrow[rrr, "\vartistc", color=artist] 
  \arrow[d, "\dfuncpullc_{\dtotalc}"', color=action] 
  \& \& \& 
  \imartist{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} 
  \arrow[d, "\dfuncpullc_{\gtotalc}", dotted] \\
  \cgamma{\opensetc^{\prime}}{\dfuncpullc_{\dtotalc}\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc^{\prime}}} 
  \arrow[dd, "\dfunctc_{\dtotalc}"', color=action] \& 
  \opensetc 
   \& 
  \opensetgc 
  \arrow[l, "\vindexc"', color=functor] 
  \& 
  \imartist{\opensetgc^{\prime}}{\dfuncpullc_{\gtotalc}\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc^{\prime}}} 
  \arrow[dd, "\dfunctc_{\gtotalc}", dotted, color=action] \\
  \& 
  \opensetc^{\prime} 
  \arrow[u, "\dfunchc_{\dtotalc}", color=action] 
  \& 
  \opensetgc^{\prime} 
  \arrow[l, "\vindexc"', color=functor] 
  \arrow[u, "\dfunchc_{\gtotalc}"', dotted, color=action] 
  \& \\
  \cgamma{\opensetc^{\prime}}{\dtotalc^{\prime}\restriction_{\opensetc^{\prime}}} 
  \arrow[rrr, "\vartistc^{\prime}", color=artist]  
  \& \& \& 
  \imartist{\opensetgc^{\prime}}{\gtotalc^{\prime}\restriction_{\opensetgc^{\prime}}}
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
such that starting at an arbitrary data point $\dsectionc(\dbasepointc)$ and transforming it into a different data point and then into a graphic 
\begin{equation*}
  \vartistc^{\prime}(\dfunctc_{\dtotalc}(\dsectionc(\dfunchc_{\dtotalc}(\vindexc(\gbasepointc^{\prime}))))) = \dfunctc_{\gtotalc}(\vartistc(\dsectionc(\vindexc(\dfunchc_{\gtotalc}(\gbasepointc^{\prime})))))
\end{equation*}
is equivalent to transforming the original data point into a graphic and then transforming the graphic into another graphic. The function $\dfunch_{\gtotal}$ induces a change in graphic generating function that matches the change in data. 

It is difficult to formally define or implement $\dfunch_{\gtotal}$ because the equivalent changes in the graphic, such as a scaling or rotation, would have to be evaluated solely on the basis of the fiber elements $\gsection(\dbasepoint)$ which are tuples of output space specifications. For example, in a 2D screen, evaluating that a scatter marker respects a change in scaling would mean translating a table of $\{x,y,r,g,b\}$ values into measurements \measure\ and then checking how those measurements change. This is equivalent to measuring components of the rendered image, as shown in the diagram

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:artist:inout:diagram}
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=huge]
    \cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} 
    \arrow[rr, "\vartistc", color=artist] 
    \arrow[d, "\equivc"', color=monoid] &  & 
    \imartist{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} 
    \arrow[d, "render"] 
    \arrow[lld, "\extractmc"', color=monoid, dashed] \\
    {\textcolor{set}{Hom}(\opensetc, \measurec)}  &  & visualization 
    \arrow[ll, "measure",]
    \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
so instead we introduce a measurement extraction function $\extractm = measure\circ render$ that decomposes the rendered output into measurable components and returns a map from the data index into the measurement space
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:artist:actual}
  \extractmc:\gsectionc \mapsto (\opensetc \xrightarrow{\extractmc_{\gsectionc}} \measurec)
\end{equation}
such that $\extractmc_{\gsectionc}(\dbasepoint)$ returns a quantification of the measurable components $\measurec_{\dbasepointc}$ of the visual element generated for the data at that point $\gsectionc|_{\vindexprec(\dbasepointc)}$. 

We also introduce a function \equivc\ that maps data to the measurement space directly 
\begin{equation}
\equivc: \dsectionc \mapsto (\opensetc \xrightarrow{\equivc_{\dsectionc}} \measurec)
\end{equation}
such that $\equivc_{\dsection}(\dbasepointc)$ is the expected set of measurements $\measure_{\dbasepoint}$. The pair of \textcolor{monoid}{verification functions} (\equivc, \extractmc) can be used to test that the expected encoding $\equivb_{\dsection}$ of the data matches the actual encoding $\extractm_{\gsection}$ 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:artist:verification}
    \equivc(\dsectionc)(\dbasepointc) = \extractmc(\vartistc(\dsectionc))(\dbasepointc) = \extractmc(\gsectionc\circ\vindexprec)(\dbasepointc)=\measurec_{\dbasepointc}
\end{equation}

An artist is equivariant when changes to expected and actual are equivariant. As introduced in \autoref{eq:atct:morphism:base}, the base space transformation \dfunch\ is invariant because $\dsection\restriction_{\openset} = \dsection\restriction_{\dfunch(\openset^{\prime})}$. This means that, for all points in the data $\dbasepoint \in \dbase$, the measurement should not change if only the base space is transformed 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:equivarance:verify:base}
  \equivc(\vartistc(\dsectionc))(\dfunch(\dbasepointc^{\prime})) = \extractmc(\vartistc(\dsectionc))(\dbasepointc)
\end{equation}
On the other hand, a change in sections \autoref{eq:atct:morphism:fiber} induces an equivalent change in measurements
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:atct:equivarance:verify:fiber}
  \equivc(\dfunctc(\dsectionc))(\dbasepoint) = \dfunctc_{\measure}(\extractmc(\vartistc(\dsectionc))(\dbasepoint))
\end{equation}
The change in measurements $\dfunctc_{\measure}$ is defined by the developer as the symmetry between data and graphic that the artist is expected to preserve. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \label{fig:artist:equivariance}
  \includegraphics[width=1\columnwidth]{equivariance.png}
  \caption{}
\end{figure}
For example, in \autoref{fig:artist:equivarance}, the measurable variable is color. This is a visual representation of the data shown in \autoref{fig:atct:phi}, and as such the equivariant transformations are an equivalent transposition and scaling of the colors. This visualization is equivariant with respect to base space transformations, as defined in \autoref{eq:atct:equivarance:verify:base}, because the color values at the new position at the old position $measure_\dbasepoint^{\prime} = \measure_{\dbasepoint}$. This visualization is also equivariant with respect to fiber wise transformations, as defined in \autoref{eq:atct:equivarance:verify:fiber}, because the colors are consistently scaled in the same was the data. For example, the values that have become 2 and 4 in the $\dfunctc$ and $\dfunc$ panels are colored the same as the original 2 and 4 values in the first panel. The equivariance in this visualization is composable, as shown in the colors being both transposed and scaled correctly in the $\dfunc$ panel.

\subsection{Artist Operators}\label{sec:artist:operators}
A common use of category theory in software engineering is the specification of modular components \cite{wielsManagementEvolvingSpecifications1998} such that we can build systems where the structure preserved by components is preserved in the composition of the components. We propose two types of artist composition, addition and multiplication. Artist addition is the composition of artists acting on distinct bundles, while artist multiplication is the composition of artists acting on different bundles over the same base space. 

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:artist:operator}
  \begin{tikzcd}[]
      & \dfiberc^{a} \times_{\dfiberc^{c}} \dfiber^{b} 
    \arrow[ld, "{\pi_{a\times b, a}}"', color=fiber] 
    \arrow[rd, "{\pi_{a\times b, b}}", color=fiber] & & 
    \dtotalc^{a} \oplus_{\dfiberc^{c}} \dtotalc^{b} 
    \arrow[ddd, "\pi"', color=total] \\
    \dfiberc^{a} 
    %\arrow[d, "\pi"', color=fiber] 
    \arrow[r, "{\pi_{a,c}}", color=fiber] 
    & \dfiberc^{c} & \dfiberc^{b} 
    %\arrow[d, "\pi", color=fiber] 
    \arrow[l, "{\pi_{b,c}}"', color=fiber] & \\
    \dbasec^{a} 
    \arrow[rd, "{\iota_{a, a+b}}"', color=base] 
    & \dbasec^{c} 
    \arrow[r, "{\iota_{c,b}}", color=base] 
    \arrow[l, "{\iota_{c,a}}"', color=base] 
    & \dbasec^{b} 
    \arrow[ld, "{\iota_{b, a+b}}", color=base] 
    &  \\
    & \dbasec^{a}\sqcup_{\dbasec^c}\dbasec^{b} & & 
    \dbasec^{a}\sqcup_{\dbasec^c}\dbasec^{b} 
    \arrow[uuu, "{\dsectionc^{a,b}}"', dashed, bend right, color=section]
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}

As illustrated in \autoref{eq:artist:operator}, data bundles can be combined by taking the disjoint  union of base spaces $\dbase^{a} \sqcup_{\dbase^c} \dbase^b$. In the trivial case where $\dtotal^{a} = \dtotal_b$, this operation is a concatenation that adds values without adding fields. In this case, given $\dbasepointc_{a} \in \dbasec_{c} \subset \dbasec_{a}$ and $\dbasepointc_{b} \in \dbasec_{c} \subset \dbasec_{b}$, if $\dbasepointc_{a} = \dbasepointc_{b}$ \note{map to same thing on overlap for same measurments}

\begin{equation}
  \equivc(\dsectionc(\dbasepointc_{a})) = \equivc(\dsectionc(\dbasepointc_{b}))
\end{equation}
for all $\dbasepointc_{a}, \dbasepointc_{b} \in \dbasec_{a}\bigsqcup\limits_{\dbasec_{c}} \dbasec_{b}$


The fibers can be combined by taking the cartesian product of the fibers $\dfiber^{a} \times_{\dfiber^c} \dfiber^{b}$. An artist acting on a cartesian product of fibers is a


The expectation that the same fiber be mapped consistently is a generalization of the expectation that the same field in different views should be encoded in the same manner\cite{hullmanKeeping2018}.



\subsubsection{Addition: +}
\label{sec:artist:addition}
 $\vartist \coloneqq \vartist^{a}(\dsectionc^{a}) + \vartist^{b}(\dsectionc^{b})$ &\\

is defined to have output 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:artist:plus:output}
  \gsectionc(\gbasepointc) = \begin{cases} \gsectionc^{a}(\dbasepointc) & \gbasepointc \in \vindexprec(\dbasec^{a}) \\
    \gsectionc^{b}(\dbasepointc) & \gbasepointc \in \vindexprec(\dbasec^{b})
  \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Multiplication: $\times$}
$\vartist \coloneqq \vartist^{a}(\dsectionc^{a}) \times \vartist^{b}(\dsectionc^{b})$
where  where $\dbase_a = \dbase_b$
 
Given that $\vindex(\gbase) = \dbase$
\begin{equation}
  \{\gsectionc^{a}(\gbasepointc), \gsectionc^{b}(\gbasepointc)\}, \gbasepointc \in \vindexprec(\dbasec)
\end{equation} 


which would require returning two points in the fiber $\gbase \rightarrow \dfiber \times \dfiber$. This function is adjoint to the addition function in \autoref{sec:artist:addition} 
\begin{equation}
  hom(\gbase, \gfiber\times \gfiber) \simeq hom(\gbase + \gbase, \gfiber)
\end{equation}
such that the $\times$ operator can be implemented as a special case of \autoref{eq:artist:plus:output} where $\gbase^a$ is a copy of $\gbase$ associated with $\gsection^a$ and $\gbase^b$ is a copy of $\gbase$ associated with $\gsection^{b}$.

For example, a box plot \cite{wickham40YearsBoxplots2011} typically consists of a rectangle, multiple lines, and scatter points. 


\section{Construction}
\label{sec:construction}
\subsection{Measurable Visual Components}

\begin{equation}
  \vfiberc \hookrightarrow \vtotalc \xrightarrow{\pi} \dbasec
\end{equation}
where
\begin{equation}
\cgamma{\opensetc}{\vtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} \coloneqq \big\{\vsectionc: \opensetc\rightarrow \vtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc} \; \bigm{\vert} \pi(\vsectionc(\dbasepointc)) = \dbasepointc\;for\, all\; \dbasepointc \in \opensetc \big\} 
\end{equation}

The bundle $\vtotal$ is structurally equivalent to the bundle $\dtotal$, but allows for separating the data that is input into the artist $\dsection$ from the data internal to the artist $\vsection$. This separation also allows for defining many of the target measurements \measure\ and the equivariant transformations to the measurements as internal components of the artists. 

\subsection{$\vindexc: \gbasec \rightarrow \dbasec$}
We define the functor $\vindex$ such that the data base space \dbase\ is a deformation retraction\cite{nlab:deformation_retract} of the graphic space $\gbase$, meaning that there is a continuous surjective mapping from every point $\dbasepoint\in\dbase$ to a point $\dbasepoint \in dbase$ . To simplify matters, in this paper, we construct the graphic space as a constant multiple of the base space such that 
\begin{equation}
  \underbrace{\opensetc\times[0,1]^{n}}_{\opensetgc} \textcolor{functor}{\xmapsto{\hspace{1em}\vindexc\hspace{1em}}} \opensetc 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation*}
  n = \begin{cases}
    dim(\gbase) - dim(\dbase) & dim(\dbase)<dim(\gbase)\\
  0 & otherwise
  \end{cases}
\end{equation*}

\subsection{Transforming Data into Measurable Components}
The transformation $\vchannel$ is a map from data sections to graphic sections
\begin{equation}
\nu: \cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} \rightarrow \cgamma{\opensetc}{\vtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}}
\end{equation}
such that the sections project to the same point on the base space $\pi(\dtotal) = \pi(\vchannel(\dtotal))$. As with artists, $\vchannel$ are maps of sections such that the composition operators defined in \autoref{sec:artist:composition} can also act on transformers $\vchannel$. 

A consequence of $\pi(\dtotal) = \pi(\vchannel(\dtotal))$ is that $\vchannelc$ can be constructed as a pointwise transformation such that  
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:constrution:nu}
  \vchannelc: \dfiberc_{\dbasepointc} \rightarrow \vfiberc_{\dbasepoint}
\end{equation}
which means that means that a point in a single data fiber $\delement \in \dfiber_{\dbasepointc}$ can be mapped into a corresponding point in a visual fiber $\velement \in \vfiber_{\dbasepointc}$. Since $\vchannel$ can be constructed as a pointwise function property, we can construct $\vchannelc$ functions 
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:construction:nu:fabrication}
  \begin{tikzcd}[col sep=Huge]
    \dfiberc_{\dbasepointc} 
    \arrow[rr, "\vchannelc", color=artist] 
    \arrow[rrrr, "\vchannelc^{\prime\prime}", dashed, bend right, color=artist] &  & 
    \vfiberc_{\dbasepointc}\coloneqq{\dfiberc_{\dbasepointc}^{\prime}} 
    \arrow[rr, "\vchannelc^{\prime}", color=artist] &  & 
    \vfiberc^{\prime}_{\dbasepointc}
  \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}
such that any new $\vchannel$ can be constructed as a composition of two or more $\vchannel$s. 

\subsubsection{Transformer Equivariance}

A pair of transformations $(\vchannel, \vchannel^{\prime})$ are equivariant if 
\begin{equation}
  \dfunct_{\vtotal} \vchannel(\dsection(\dbasepoint)) = \vchannel(\dfunct_{\dtotal}(\dsection(\dbasepoint)))
\end{equation}
for all $\dbasepoint \in \dbase$.  Since the visual sections and data sections are over the same space $\dfunc$

\begin{equation}

\subsection{Compositing Measurable Components into Output}
The compositing function $\vmarkc$ transforms the sections of visual elements $\vsectionc$ into sections of graphics $\gsectionc$.
\begin{equation}
  \vmarkc: \cgamma{\opensetc}{\vtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} \rightarrow \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}}
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:construction:q:fabrication}
  \begin{tikzcd}
      \cgamma{\opensetc}{\vtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} 
      \arrow[rr, "\vchannel", color=artist] 
      \arrow[rrrr, "\vmarkc^{\prime}"', bend right, color=artist, dashed] &  & \cgamma{\opensetc}{\vtotalc^{\prime}\restriction_{\opensetc}} 
      \arrow[rr, "\vmarkc", color=artist] &  & \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}}
      \end{tikzcd} 
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Compositor Equivariance}

As mentioned in \autoref{sec:construction:nu}, the distinction between data sections $\dsection$ and visual sections $\vsection$ is semantic rather than structural. Therefore, the equivariance condition on the sheaf map with a change of base space $\vmarkc$ is identical to the one for artists shown in \autoref{eq:artist:equivariance} such that an equivariant \vmark\ must satisify the condition 
\begin{equation}
  \vmarkc(\dfunctc_{\vtotalc}(\vsectionc(\dfunchc_{\vtotalc}(\vindexc(\gbasepointc^{\prime}))))) = \dfunctc_{\gtotalc}(\vmarkc(\vsectionc(\vindexc(\dfunchc_{\gtotalc}(\gbasepointc^{\prime})))))  
\end{equation}
which means that any change to a measurable component input must have a measurably equivalent change in the output. 

As with the artist, it is difficult to work with the output section \gsection\ directly and instead we test the compositer \vmark\ using measurements derived from the output. A compositer is expected to pass visual transformers \vsection\ through to their expected visual measurements, as described in \autoref{def:construction:nu:validate}, such that any shared visual components at a point $\vsection^{a}(\dbasepoint)$ must render to the same measurement $\measure^{a}_{\dbasepoint}$
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:construction:q:validate}
  \begin{tikzcd}[row sep=huge]
    \cgamma{\opensetc}{(\vtotalc^{a}\times \vtotalc^{b})\restriction_{\opensetc}}  
    \arrow[rr, "\vmarkc_{ab}", color=artist] \arrow[d, "\pi_a"', color=total] &  &  \imartistsub{ab}{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} 
    \arrow[d, "\measurec\restriction_a \circ \extractmc_{ab}", color=monoid]  \\
   \cgamma{\opensetc}{\vtotalc^{a}\restriction_{\opensetc}} 
   \arrow[rr, "\simeq", dotted] &  & {\textcolor{set}{Hom}(\opensetc, \measurec^{a})}                                                                             \\
    \cgamma{\opensetc}{(\vtotalc^{a}\times \vtotalc^{c})\restriction_{\opensetc}}  \arrow[rr, "\vmarkc_{ab}", color=artist] \arrow[u, "\pi_a", color=total]  &  &  \imartistsub{ac}{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} \arrow[u, "\measurec\restriction_a \circ \extractmc_{ac}"', color=monoid]
   \end{tikzcd}
\end{equation}


\note{when $Q_{ab} = Q_{bc}$, this says only things that change are the parameter controlled pieces}

\subsection{Constructing the Artist: $\vartistc=\vmarkc\circ\vchannelc$}

As shown in \autoref{eq:atct:sheaves:homset}, sheaves equipped with transport functors have isomorphic maps between the sheaves. This property, allows us to specify the transformation from data to graphic space in data or graphic space or a combination, as listed in \autoref{eq:artist:hom_transport}, such that the following diagram commutes:
\begin{equation}
  \label{eq:construction:artist:path}
\begin{tikzcd}[row sep=2.5em, column sep=1.5em]
  \cgamma{\opensetc}{\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} 
  \arrow[rr, "\vchannelc^{\dbasec}", color=artist] 
  \arrow[rrrr, "\vartistc^{\dbasec}", bend left, color=artist] 
  \arrow[dd, "\vindexpullc"', color=functor] 
  \arrow[rrrrdd, "\vartistc", color=artist, pos=.2] &  & 
  \cgamma{\opensetc}{\vtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}} 
  \arrow[rrdd, "\vmarkc", color=artist] 
  \arrow[rr, "\vmarkc^{\dbasec}", color=artist] 
  \arrow[dd, "\vindexpullc", color=functor, pos=.2] &  & \imartist{\opensetc}{\vindexpushc\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetc}}  \\
   & & & & \\
  \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\vindexpullc\dtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} \arrow[rr, "\vchannelc^{\gbasec}", color=artist] 
  \arrow[rrrr, "\vartistc^{\gbasec}", bend right, color=artist] & & 
  \cgamma{\opensetgc}{\vindexpullc\vtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} \arrow[rr, "\vmarkc^{\gbasec}", color=artist] &  & 
  \imartist{\opensetgc}{\gtotalc\restriction_{\opensetgc}} \arrow[uu, "\vindexpushc"', color=functor]
\end{tikzcd}  
\end{equation}
The diagram in \autoref{eq:construction:artist:path} illustrates how a developer can connect transformations over data space, denoted with a subset $\dbase$, with transformations over graphic space $\gbase$, using $\vindexpushc$ and $\vindexpullc$ adaptors. This allows developers to for example connect transformers that transform data on a line to a color in dataspace, but build a line compositing function that dynamically resamples what is on screen in graphic space. x
