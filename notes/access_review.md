Review:
This paper suggests a method for fully specifying arbitrary data into a visualization using code, based on mathematical formalisms. There is a mention that this method can also be applied to non-visual modalities.

In general? Awesome idea. I think this is a very cool piece and has really interesting implications. I'd love to see this at the workshop, stimulating discussion. I bet a few tool-makers in our community will be interested in this, especially.

However, I am not well-versed in topology or anything formal in mathematical research, so it was nearly impossible for me to fully understand. I get the core idea, but I am not sure how to follow most of the figures (and the piece also jumps right into concepts like ""sheaf formalism"" and ""fiber bundles"" without introduction or explanation, which requires heavy lifting!). I worry this piece will not effectively communicate what really matters to the workshop attendees and future readers

I would love to accept this piece, but I believe it needs work before it is ready for the workshop. Virtually all of my suggestions (in the following section) are about making this piece a successful artifact of communication between our peers. The idea is solid, but I believe it needs help bridging communication gaps between our complex intersection of disciplines.

That being said, I am offically arguing for the inclusion of the piece, even though my suggestion list is quite long. Perhaps the authors can accomplish some or all of my suggestions in time. But still, as a work-in-progress, this would be well-situated in our community. Also: we don't have any topology folks present, as far as I know. It would be great to include them and their way of framing and thinking about problems.

Recommendations:

Overall, the piece needs more plain/non-specialized language, introduction to field-specific terminology in the body of the piece, clear labels on the subparts of figures (which are then referenced in text), and most of all: a call to action for the peers who will be present at the workshop.

My suggested changes are:
1. First and foremost, this is a position paper to peers who have a wide breadth of different expertise. A position paper should have a particular rhetorical force present that isn't often permitted in a regular paper. A position paper should convince its readers of something at the heart of its work: why does it matter? why was it written? why should workshop attendees stew on this and follow up on it in their own future work? Workshops are about inspiring others to collaborate and solve tricky problems together. So: a workshop paper especially must convince the workshop attendees (as the first readers of the piece): why does this work matter to them and what should they do now? The piece feels more explanatory than anything, as it is. I would love to see this work introduce a clear problem with concrete consequences in an accessibility context, and then offer a path forward. Reading this, I'm left wondering: Right now, are tools not faithful or accurate enough? And how does this affect people with disabilities? How does a lack of faithfulness and accuracy in existing tools impact our ability to produce new encodings? Or are tools faithful and accurate enough, but the real ""problem"" lies elsewhere? I have a feeling that this is the case. In Zong's work on Umwelt (a citation that I highly recommend reading because it relates to this), the ""problem"" is that our tools are too visually-centric, and other encodings are then downstream from visuals. This creates forgotten accessibility work, it also makes non-visual modalities subject to visual-first metaphors and design priorities before being translated into non-visuals. That can have a real impact on blind people's experiences of data. Umwelt challenges this: what if we de-centered all sensory encodings and simply centered data, first? This piece has a similar core argument, I think. But... is it clearly said? Reading this, I interpret the piece as: ""we have a new data structure and mathematically-informed methodology that is more accurate and faithful to data. this can be used to make new encodings, by tweaking a few things in our process."" But I am not sure what the problem is with existing methods or why this method leads to a better world. The readers of this piece will want to know! (And as a note: I brought up Zong's piece Umwelt not because I hope the authors say something novel - perhaps the point is simply to agree with Umwelt's argument for why centering tools on data first matters for accessibility, but that Umwelt's methods could be formalized more thoroughly or something! As an example/suggestion: The vega lite paper (Satyanarayan et al) is great because the core point isn't that a grammar of graphics is new but that their approach enables a whole lot more to be done that was previously difficult or nearly impossible.)
2. Define and introduce any and all specialized terminology in the body of the piece, if possible. An attached glossary will likely not be read (it's okay to have this, but it adds challenge to the immediate cognitive accessibility of the document if it is the only source of definitions for words.) I reckon that few readers are familiar with what ""sheaf formalism"" or ""Dirichilet distribution"" means and might just ignore this paper once they see these concepts. My suggestion here also goes further than definitions. Readers will also want to know *why* and not just *what.* So what my suggestion means is that this piece needs to do significant translation between concepts like ""fiber bundles"" from topology into a clear takeaway of ""first, here is what fiber bundles are and then here is why this effective and useful for someone who might not understand topology."" I'd introduce all core terms up front in a section: treat this like teaching the reader how to read the rest of the paper. Be clear, concise, and assume they don't know much about specific concepts. The intro has a great statement ""our methodology..."" (which lists all the things that are integrated in the methodology). But... what are all of these things? Why do they matter to mention at all? What problems do they solve? I've read Bertin and Mackinlay, but even so: I'm curious to know what *exactly* in Bertin or Jock's work are part of the methodology and why!
3. The figures could use a lot of help. I bet if this was submitted to a group that understands topology (and mathematical notation) well, it would be a hit. I can very slowly read a geometric proof (lol) and understand some logical formalisms. But I have a really hard time reading these! For example, in figure 1 the caption is: ""This weather station data has multiple embedded continuities - points at each time and position, timeseries at each position, and maps at each time - that are expected to be homeomorphic to the continuity of their respective visualizations."" What are the continuities? What are the points at each time and position? What about this is or isn't homeomorphic? And what does homeomorphic mean and why is it important? I'd suggest labeling subparts in each image and then referencing the labels in the caption, like: ""multiple embedded continuities (A)..."" Another example of this: Figure 2 starts off with ""the scatter marker"" - what in the figure is the scatter marker? How do I interpret what the lines are? Why is the graph-looking box wavy shaped? How do I read the equation at the top?
4. As a suggestion, consider moving all of the figures to an appendix, to give you more room to write. It's not cheating to have 4 pages of writing and then 5 pages of figures in the appendix! heh. This is just a suggestion though. I think with really simple and clean figures that have a clear takeaway and connection to the body of the text, they are okay in the body of the piece too.
5. The figures could also use more inline explanation/connection (whether or not you do #4). An example of inline connection might be: ""[concept] is a hard problem, which we work through using [technique]. You can see an example of this in action in [figure]."" etc.
6. There are some formatting issues with the author names and table 1. Also, it is really hard to go from page 1 to 2 because ""specifications"" is a widow, (a solo word at the end of a paragraph, separated by a page - this is a typography term for this phenomenon).
7. I would suggest adding at least 1 concrete and clear example of how someone could replicate the claim in this statement: ""by changing the last of the three fiber bundles (the graphic bundle) we discuss in Section 2, we could go from a visual representation to an auditory, haptic, or any other modality and retain the benefits we identify from the fiber bundle and sheaf structures."" How so? Are auditory encodings easily transferrable? Tactile? How would that work? I'm left to my imagination. With this point, the paper appears to be about math with a downstream benefit for accessibility - I'd love to see the accessibility part of this more central to the motivation and argument. Why would we need a tool that can do this? What is wrong with current approaches? And of course, how do we make it possible? (this relates to point #1 of mine, above)
8. Lastly it would be lovely to see some code, side-by-side with notation (and bonus also include the output representation). Such as: mention a particular concept shown in a formal notation, a code representation of that notation, and then the output. This might be a tall order on short notice, but as of now, I (a code-friendly person) would love to generalize this approach to my non-matplotib environments, but am not sure how to go from the formal notation into code. This suggestion might help others accomplish a practical application of this work more broadly.
