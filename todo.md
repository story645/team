1. look up product and coproduct
   1. bicartesian is a special case of monoidal category - 
   2. figure out what our actual base case is 
   3. F is a monoid & preserve that structure in a fiber bundle
      1. can be a cross product & that will be part of the monoidal structure 
   4. add in to background maybe what we mean by product 
2. given map 
   * f: K->F_1, g:K->F_2
   * if composite artist $A(f) \times A(g)$, $Hom(F_1,F_2) \cong Hom(F_1 \times F_2)$
