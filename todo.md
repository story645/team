1. pullback - restriction: iota is restriction 
2. clean up $K^{op}$ definition
3. rename f:E\rightarrow E to different letter
4. image of a sheaf is a sheaf, is not a category, is a contravariant functor, write words about what Im_A is 
5. eq 8:  not all \Gamma(U,H) is reachable from imA, only a subset of \Gamma(U,H ) reachable via A, sheaf im_A is im_A: S^{op} to \textit{Set}, subcategory im_A - collection of subsets of sets in P -> for \Gamma object in P, subset of that \Gamma is in imQ, 
6. rename (5) to an association rather than a function? notation for morphism of functors
7.  ditch the tau category altogether, rewrite graphics paragraph w/o P
8.  ditch (8) 

# artist composition: 
1. how do we express that we're intending b and not a? 
2. operations are restrictions on ranges 
3. map x to vv, identifying x via projections to induce same transform -> factor through x3 
### artist composition
1. disjoint union of unlike things
2. base space inclusions -> inclusion maps are on S too
3. fiber projections over one point -> sum w/ understanding to be linked, for d to commute they have to have consistent inclusion - fibers keep projecting up, concatenating columns, -> tuple keeps going up
